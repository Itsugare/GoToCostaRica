          <p>The flag of Costa Rica was officially adopted on September 29, 1848. The blue and white are the original colors used by the United Provinces of Central America, while the combined red, white and blue are modeled after the colors of the French Tricolore. The country's coat of arms is found on the red panel and the three volcanoes in the country are featured.

        <div>
          <p>The original sheet music by Manuel Maria Gutierrez is dated at 1852. He wrote the piece in just three days, when a national anthem was urgently needed before the arrival of US dignitaries. The lyrics were penned by Jose Maria Zeledon Brenes, which were declared official in 1949 after a long series of alternative lyrics had been considered since 1879. Costa Rican National Anthem

        <h3>Section 4: National Flower</h3>
        <div>
          <p>La Guaria Morada (Guarianthe skinneri). Toward the end of the 1930’s, the director of Argentina’s parks and gardens and the Annual Tropical Flower exposition of Miami needed a Costa Rican national flower. The Rotary Club and the Garden Club organized a competition to select the flower. The competition was to be held throughout the entire country and the flowers entered had to be native to America and present in Costa Rican traditions and legends. The “Cattleyaskinneri” (Guaria Morada) was selected as the national flower on June 15, 1939.
