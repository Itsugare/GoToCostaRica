Located in the peninsula of Nicoya, Playa Carrillo is full of palm trees and white sand.
The coast is usually never crowded, making it a perfect place to relax and escape the stressful
days at work. While you relax, you can enjoy breathtaking scenery of the lush mountains that are
drawn in the distance and which act as a beautiful frame for the beach.

Although Playa Carrillo is not as developed as all the other neighboring beaches,
this may prove beneficial for tourists looking to enjoy a variety of outdoor activities in the long run.
 Diving and swimming on the beaches are one of the most popular forms of recreation on the beach,
 with a spectacular coral reef right at the bottom of the waters. Other popular sports to participate
  in Playa Carrillo are kayaking, jet skiing, water skiing and sport fishing.
